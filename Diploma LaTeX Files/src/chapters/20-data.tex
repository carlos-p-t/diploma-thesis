This chapter introduces the datasets used to train the models in our pipeline. Important insights about these datasets will be provided, along with the distribution of images into their subsets for training, validation, and testing of the object detector, as well as the predefined classes for the classification system. Additionally, details about the annotation and preprocessing of this data will be discussed.
