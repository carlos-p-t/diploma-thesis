\section{Resources}\label{ch:resources}

Initially, free resources were used to train our first models. We alternated between Google Colab's free GPU resources and Google Cloud Computing Services. The former offered daily free GPU usage for up to 3 hours in total, while Google Cloud services operated based on credits. Although these training methods served well as an introduction to our current work, they were very limited in terms of usage time and availability. As a result, we performed most of our training using the Department of Applied Informaticsâ€™ GPU Computing Servers.\\

We started our experiments on the Uran server; however, after the addition of the Jupiter server, we switched to the latter due to its larger storage and increased RAM capabilities. Training experiments were conducted on 2 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super GPUs, each with 16 GB of RAM.\\

All created scripts for data pre-processing, training, and results visualization are Python-based, using frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, among others. For image annotation, RoboFlow and Segment Anything online interface applications were used.
