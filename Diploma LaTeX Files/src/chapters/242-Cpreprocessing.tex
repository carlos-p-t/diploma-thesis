\subsection{Data Preparation for Classification Task}\label{sec:preprocessingclassification}

This specific part of the thesis is under development. Currently, we are attempting to extract as many billboard images as possible using the BillboardLamac classification subset of images. These images will be classified according to the pre-defined classes introduced earlier, and the system will be trained using both a pre-trained YOLO classification model and RESNET. We will then compare both models to determine which one achieves better performance.
