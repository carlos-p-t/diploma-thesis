\section{Classifier}\label{sec:classifier}

\textit{This part is currently under development.}\\

The classification task involves training a classifier that can correctly classify driver gaze durations into four classes based on billboard features from the BillboardLamac classification images dataset. This aims to evaluate how long drivers focus on billboards and understand its potential impact on distraction. We plan to conduct training experiments using two pretrained models: YOLO-classification and RESNET50. The two best models (one from each pretrained model) will be selected based on their metric results. For this classification task, the metrics to consider will be Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
