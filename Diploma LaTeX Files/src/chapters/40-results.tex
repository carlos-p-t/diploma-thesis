This chapter presents the results obtained after training the object detector and gaze classification models. The first section describes the evaluation process of the different YOLO-based detection models after completing their respective base training and fine-tuning. We will also present the metrics obtained and the criteria used to select the two best base training models, including visualizations of performance metrics. The second section will focus on displaying the results of the driver gaze classification system (currently under development).
