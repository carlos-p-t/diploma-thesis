\section{Pipeline Integration}\label{ch:pipelineintegration}

\textit{This section will be completed once the classification system training is finished.}\\

The final pipeline will integrate the object detection model with the classification model. Detected billboards from YOLO will be input into the gaze classifier, which will predict the duration of driver attention. Results will be stored for analysis of correlations between billboard visibility and distraction.
