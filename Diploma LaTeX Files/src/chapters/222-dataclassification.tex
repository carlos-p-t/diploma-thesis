\subsection{Data for Classification}\label{sec:dataclassification}

The classification task is currently under development. This section uses a subset of the BillboardLamac dataset for classification, divided into four defined gaze duration classes. Each class contains a set of images, with each image assigned a unique ID. This ID is linked to additional information about the billboards in each image, such as their locations, sizes, and the images themselves. Various strategies are being employed to process this information effectively for training the classification system; details about these experiments will be added once they are concluded. The classification subset is detailed in Table 2.3. \\
