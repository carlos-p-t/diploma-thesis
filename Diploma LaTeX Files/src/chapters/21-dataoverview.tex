\section{Data Overview}\label{sec:dataoverview}

The development of the pipeline of this thesis makes use of two datasets: the Mapillary Vistas dataset and the BillboardLamac dataset. These datasets were chosen due to their focus on street-level objects and billboards, aligning with the objectives of this study. \\

The Mapillary Vistas dataset is a large and diverse street-level imagery dataset, which is used for computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. This dataset consists of images from urban and rural areas, captured under different conditions such as lighting, weather, and geographic locations. It includes instance-specific human annotations, which include billboards. This dataset was chosen to train the object detection model since we believe it would be a suitable foundation to detect roadside advertisements in complex environments. \\

On the other hand, the BillboardLamac dataset focuses exclusively on roadside billboards and driver behavior. This dataset was created in a previous work, and it provides high-resolution images with billboard annotations. A good portion of the dataset is dedicated to the fine-tuning of the object detector for improving its accuracy. Additionally, the dataset includes driver gaze information that is currently being used for developing the classification system that categorizes the driversâ€™ gaze duration into predefined classes. \\
