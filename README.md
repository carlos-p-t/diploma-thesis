## About the Seminar 2 Course requirements

Following the instructions from the [Seminar 2](https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/w/Course:Project_Seminar_2/sk) course, this repository contains the following:

1) A presentation of the results of the Diploma Thesis for the Seminar 2 course (both a Power Point presentation and a PDF version of it).

2) A sample of the Diploma Thesis with the minimum of 15 pages in LaTeX including the front pages, abstract (in both languages), a list of the literature used in a PDF version (LaTeX files also included).

3) Samples of the implementation of the project with visual results in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

4) Electronic samples studied for developing this part of the project.

## Brief description of the Project and the current development

**Objective:** To develop an automated system which evaluates road advertisement significance.

**Development:** In two phases: object detector development, classification system development.

For the **_Seminar 1_** course, a first attempt to train an object detector was made by merging 2 datasets (a larger one and a smaller one) achieving initial results.

For the **_Seminar 2_** course, after analyzing previous results, a different training method was tested: Training an object detector on the largest dataset first, and then fine-tune the resulting model in the smaller dataset, achieving significantly better results.

Additionally, we introduce our current work with the classification system (*under development*).
